# S-19

## Bug Description
The XQUIC server will still respond to Initial packets after moving to the Handshake encryption level, as well as responding to Handshake packets after moving to the 1-RTT encryption level (when the handshake is confirmed). XQUIC does not follow the specification as stated in Section 4.9 of RFC9001, a QUIC server must discard the unused keys after moving to a new encryption level. For example, a server must discard its Initial key after it processes the first Handshake packet from the client so that the subsequent Initial packets will not be processed.

## Impacted Servers & Versions
XQUIC (Tested on commit 00f62288)

## Input Sequence
[Input.INITIAL_CLIENT_HELLO_VALID_ACK, Input.INITIAL_CONNECTION_CLOSE]
