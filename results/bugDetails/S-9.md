According to RFC9000, if active\_connection\_id\_limit is absent in the transport parameter, a default limit of 2 is assumed. Even when sending 1000 connection IDs to the server using the INVALID_NEW_CONNECTION_ID message, and the server processes all new connection IDs without closing the connection.
