# L-2

## Bug Description
The implemented logic uses the incorrect direction of pruning a double-linked re-transmission queue in ```picoquic/sender.c:picoquic_implicit_handshake_ack()```.

## Impacted Servers & Versions
PQUIC (Tested on commit 841c8228)

## Input Sequence
[Input.INITIAL_CLIENT_HELLO_VALID_ACK, Input.HANDSHAKE_FINISHED, Input.INVALID_NEW_CONNECTION_ID]

## Detailed Case Study (Moved from paper)
**Incorrect method of emptying the re-transmission queue.** Because Pquic is built on top of the older Picoquic library, it shared the issue **M-4** discussed in Section 5.2 with Picoquic. However, unlike Picoquic, which attempts to access a ```NULL``` pointer to obtain the encryption key for re-transmission, Pquic will always have access to the encryption keys because it never discards them---see **S-10**.

**Impact.** This behaviour causes the server to re-transmit acknowledged messages to the peer, unnecessarily increasing network traffic and reducing the utility of network bandwidth.
