# QT10 ([CVE-2024-25678](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25678))

## Bug Description
Once a key is created for an encryption level, the server will continue decrypting and processing packets from that encryption level, even after moving to a new encryption level. This allows attackers to disrupt a connection with a PSK configuration by sending a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame that is encrypted via the initial key computed. Network traffic sniffing is needed as part of exploitation.

## Impacted Servers & Versions
