# QT50

## Bug Description
The Lsquic server will still respond to Initial packets after moving to the Handshake encryption level, as well as responding to Handshake packets after moving to the 1-RTT encryption level (when the handshake is confirmed). Lsquic does not follow the specification as stated in Section 4.9 of RFC9001, a QUIC server must discard the unused keys after moving to a new encryption level. For example, a server must discard its Initial key after it processes the first Handshake packet from the client so that the subsequent Initial packets will not be processed. However, this bug only exists in Lsquic's PSK configuration.

## Impacted Servers & Versions
Lsquic (Tested on commit 1b113d19 with PSK configuration)

## Input Sequence
