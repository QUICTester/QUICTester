## Bug Description
When sending an INITIAL_PING as the first message of the connection to the server, the server does not acknowledge the INITIAL_PING. Rather than responding with a Ping_ACK message, the server sends an INITIAL_PING back to the client.

## Impacted Servers & Versions
Quant (Tested on commit 511d91c3)

# Fixed Version
Developers acknowledge findings. Not fixed because the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NTAP/quant/issues/83) is no longer under active maintenance.

## Input Sequence
[Input.INITIAL_PING]
