# M-8 ([CVE-2023-42805](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42805))

## Bug Description
Unexpected frame types were not always handled correctly. Use of the Unwrap() function on a None value could occur when processing an unexpected frame. This allows an attacker to perform a DoS attack on the server.

## Impacted Servers & Versions
Quinn (Tested on commit 4395b969 & 0af891e0)

## Fixed Version
This bug was fixed in version [0.9.5](https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/security/advisories/GHSA-q8wc-j5m9-27w3).

## Input Sequence
[Input.INITIAL_PING, Input.INITIAL_UNEXPECTED_FRAME_TYPE]

## Detailed Case Study (Moved from paper)
**Null Pointer Dereference in Quinn.** When testing Quinn, our crash logger detected crashes when handling ```hndUnxpFrType```. These crashes arise from Quinn *panicking* when it attempts to unwrap a  ```None``` value after matching an unexpected frame to the ```Type``` enum. 

**Impact** This allows an attacker to perform a DoS attack using a malformed packet (```hndUnxpFrType```). Notably, the bug exists in both the server and client implementations since they share the same library. We responsibly reported this vulnerability to the Quinn developers. This vulnerability was assigned *CVE-2023-42805* with high severity and patched.
